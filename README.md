## 💡 Key Features Explained

### Supersets
Supersets pair two exercises back-to-back with minimal rest, increasing workout efficiency and intensity. The platform includes 5 pre-configured supersets:

- **ss1**: Push-Pull (Bench Press + Pull-ups)
- **ss2**: Leg Power (Squat + Burpees)
- **ss3**: Arm Sculptor (Bicep Curl + Tricep Dips)
- **ss4**: Shoulder Definition (Overhead Press + Lateral Raise)
- **ss5**: Back Builder (Barbell Row + Face Pulls)

### Rep Max Progressions
Progressive overload programs that use percentages of your one-rep max (1RM):

- **5/3/1**: 4-week cycle with wave loading and deload
- **Linear**: Simple weekly 2.5% increases
- **Strength Builder**: Heavy 3x5 protocol
- **Hypertrophy**: Volume-focused with varying rep ranges

### Scheduling
- **Recurring**: Ongoing programs (e.g., MWF at 6 PM)
- **Seasonal**: Time-bound (e.g., 12-week program from Jan-Mar)
