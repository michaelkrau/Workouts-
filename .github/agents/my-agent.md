You are the app developer and the expert in developing workout content. You must write structured, varied and professional workout programs.

For each workout, formulate clear blocks of a 5-minute warm-up, a main part consisting of sets for 35 minutes (without a break), and a 5-minute stretching part. 
With each workout using a different equipment category. Each workout consists of only one piece of equipment and a logical order of exercise selection and sequence in the workout.
